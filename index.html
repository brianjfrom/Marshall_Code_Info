        The Marshall Code offers many different types of Marshall Amps in single amplifier.
      </h2>
      <div class="amp jtm45">
        <h3>JTM-45</h3>
        <p>The JTM45 was the first Marshall amplifier. It was made in 1962 by Jim Marshall and his small team of engineers in a workshop at his music store in Hanwell, London. This 30 Watt two channel amplifier began a revolution that changed forever the
          sound of rock and blues music.</p>

        <h3>1962 Bluesbreaker</h3>
        <p>
          The 1962 Bluesbreaker was the first combo made by Marshall. Launched in 1965, it had two 12” speakers with an output of 30 Watts.

        <h3>1959 Pleaxi</h3>
        <p>
          To the minds and ears of many, the 100 Watt Super Lead heads of the mid to late 1960s are the holy grail of great rock tone. Being non-master-volume, when cranked, the 1959 power valves overdrive producing highly responsive, harmonically rich tones.

      <div class="amp jcm">
        <h3>JCM800 2203</h3>
        <p>
          The 2203 is one of the most important amplifiers Marshall has ever made. It evolved in the ‘70s from the JMP and 1959 Plexi heads. In the ‘80s the 2203 became the JCM800 2203 we know today: a straightforward single channel amplifier that was favoured
          by the heavy metal scene that dominated much of that decade. Its popularity remained well into the ‘90s with the emergence of Grunge and Britpop, and it’s still revered today and is considered the benchmark by which modern all metal amplifiers
          are measured.

        <h3>JCM2555 Silver Jubilee</h3>
        <p>The 25/50 Silver Jubilee Series was created in 1987 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of Marshall Amplification and 50 years of Jim Marshall being in the music business. Based on the JCM800 2203 and 2204™ Master Volume models,
          Silver Jubilee amplifiers had a special preamp circuit that featured three gain ‘modes’ which were Clean, Rhythm Clip and a switchable Lead Channel. The 2555 was the 100 Watt head in the Jubilee series, which was a limited edition. By popular
          demand the JCM2555 was re-issued as the 2555X™ in 2015</p>

      <div class="amp dsl">
        <h3>JCM2000 DSL100</h3>
        <p>
          JCM2000 Dual Super Lead’s ‘dual mode’ design meant that guitarists could choose either a Clean or Crunch tone from the Classic Gain Channel, whilst the Ultra Gain Channel provided two lead sounds: Lead 1 & Lead 2. This tonal versatility was aided by the
          Deep and Tone Shift features. It is the JCM2000 DSL100’s tonal range and versatility that made it massively popular in its day.

      <div class="amp jvm">
        <h3>JVM410H</h3>
        <p>
          This 100 Watt head is an all-valve tonal monster that has four channels, each with three modes: Green, Orange and Red, offering guitarists a range of 12 unique tones. Each mode reconfigures the channel gain stages in order to develop different amounts
          of gain and tone. The JVM410H’s vast tonal spectrum makes it the most versatile amplifier Marshall has ever made.
